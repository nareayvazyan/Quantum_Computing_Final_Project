We are playing the binary version of Master Mind. In this version, we are working with two colors, represented by 1 and 0, and the sequence consists of 4 digits, resulting in a total of 16 possible numbers: 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111. 
The Keeper secretly selects a sequence, denoted as X. The Guesser begins by making a guess, such as 0000. The Keeper then evaluates the guess and provides a score, indicating the number of correct digits in their correct positions. In this particular case the Keeper says that the score is 1 (compare 0000 with x score is 1), then the Gusser compares this 0000 and with the above mentioned 16 numbers and writing scores to see which comparisons will have score 1.

1. compare 0000 with 0000 : score 4
2. compare 0000 with 0001: score 3
3. compare 0000 with 0010: score 3
4. compare 0000 with 0011: score 2
5. compare 0000 with 0100: score 3
6. compare 0000 with 0101: score 2
7. compare 0000 with 0110: score 2
8. compare 0000 with 0111: score 1
9. compare 0000 with 1000: score 3
10. compare 0000 with 1001: score 2 
11. compare 0000 with 1010: score 2
12. compare 0000 with 1011: score 1
13. compare 0000 with 1100: score 2
14. compare 0000 with 1101: score 1
15. compare 0000 with 1110: score 1
16. compare 0000 with 1111: score 0

We see that score 1 have 0111 1011 1101 1110. So we will continue with these 4 numbers.

The next guess is 0111. The keeper reveals a score of 2, indicating two matches with 'x'. The guesser then compares 0111 with the four potential candidates:

Compare 0111 with 0111: Score 4 
Compare 0111 with 1011: Score 2 
Compare 0111 with 1101: Score 2
Compare 0111 with 1110: Score 2 

Subsequently, the guesser selects 1101, receiving a score of 2 from the keeper:

Compare 1101 with 1101: Score 4
Compare 1101 with 1011: Score 2
Compare 1101 with 1110: Score 2

Continuing, the guesser proposes 1011, again receiving a score of 2:

Compare 1011 with 1011: Score 4
Compare 1011 with 1110: Score 2

Thus, the keeper's hidden number is 1110.
